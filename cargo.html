					<h4>Legend of Cargo: Awakened Sea</h4>
					<h3 style='font-size: 18px'>Steal from the Crown by Smuggling what's Needed</h3>
					<h5>What This Game is</h5>
					<p>The Legend of Cargo is an intense high speed game where a crew of smugglers attempts to
					navigate passages across the world that most wouldnâ€™t dare in order to keep their goods 
					and themselves from getting caught by the royal navy. You guide the team through mazes 
					of rocks and whirlpools while shooting down any sea monsters or navy ships that cross 
					into your path. The goal of the game is to get from one port to another without losing all 
					of your precious cargo. With its up-scrolling, top down gameplay, you can never be 
					entirely sure what awaits you up ahead.</p>

					<h5>Where the Game Came from</h5>
					<p> The Legend of Cargo is a project that I did in my 2D Animation and Asset Production. 
					For the project, we had to create our own game art and implement it into an Unity project 
					created for the shoot em up gameplay type. We also had to animate our assets and learned how to
					create parallax scrolling layers for the game. </p>
					
					<h5>The Style of the Game</h5>
					<p>For the game, I created all of my art using a mixture of Adobe Illustrator and Abobe Photoshop.
					The art is flat, and cartoonish in nature.I also changed the layout from right to left scrolling, as 
					it came with the original code. I however wanted a top to bottom game and taught myself Unity in more depth
					in order to make that happen. </p>
