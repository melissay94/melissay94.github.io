					<h4>Glance Data Analyzer</h4>
					<h3 style="font-size:18px;">An accessible way to create and interact with data</h3>
					<h5>About the Project</h5>
					<p>The Glance Data Analyzer is a web application that allows visually disabled users to create/download and interact with data using sonification and screen readers. Users may either download a data set in a csv format to the site or create a blank table and fill it in themselves. Data generates a graph representation that can be analyzed by visually impaired users by listening to the tones created by the data. The application also creates a summary of the data for the users to read. The application was made using HTML/CSS and JavaScript.</p>
					<h5>Where the Project Came From</h5>
					<p>Glancewas developed by the Center of Accessibility and Inclusion Research here at the RochesterInstitute of Technology in the Golisano College of Computing and Information Sciences. My team made the web app during the summer of 2015 as part of the curriculum for a data analysis unit from a intro to computing class. </p>
					<h5>My Main Role</h5>
					<p>With this project, I worked mostly on the functionality of the data table used by the application. I also acted as a team leader, helping to finalize design choices, organize the work needed to be done for the project, and help with issues that popped up as necessary.</p>
