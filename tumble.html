					<h4>A New Look for Tumbleinn.net</h4>
					<h3>Bringing an old site an entire new look</h3>
					<h5> Why a Revamp </h5>
					<p>The point of this project was to find a site online, in my case Tumbleinn.net, and give it a new look. When I first got
					to the site while looking for vacations spot, the entire site was positioned in the top left corner and didn't resize at all. 
					It was designed to look like a book, which while cool in theory, was less than ideal visually.</p>
					<div class="innPics">
						<img src="images/tumbleBad.jpg" alt="tumble inn intro page" />
						<img src="images/tumbleBadHome.jpg" alt="tumble inn home page" />
					</div>
					<p> I really hated this site when I went to it. It actually made me not want to stay at the inn 
					based on their poor web design. Thankfully, since I completed my project, they themselves have redone 
					the site and it's much easier on the eyes. </p> 
					<h5>My Designs</h5>
