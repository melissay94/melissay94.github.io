				<h4>Button Grid Game</h4>
				<h3>A Simply Frustrating Experience</h3>
				<h5>Where the Game Came From</h5>
				<p>This game was a simple for fun project I started this summer after a coworker complained about all the buttons we had to create for a project. As such I decided it would be funny to create a simple game for them that is nothing but buttons. The game turned out better than I thought it would so I kept working on it and have plans to keep improving it this year.</p>
				<h5>What the Game is</h5>
				<p>The objective of the game is to push the right combination of buttons to match the key given on each level. The twist to the game is that some of the buttons will light up other buttons on the grid and you won't know which ones until you've hit that particular button. I created the game using HTML/CSS and JavaScript.</p>
				<h5>Future Plans for Button Grid</h5>
				<p>My plans to improve the game for this year would be to figure out a way to both create new boards randomly and be able to make sure they are solvable without having to test them over and over again. While creating the random boards should be simple, the difficult part will come in making sure that the board randomly generated has an actual soluntion before allowing it as a game level.</p>
