				<h4>Hi! I'm Melissa</h4>
				<h3 style="font-size: 18px;">Current Game Design and Development major at the Rochester Institute of Technology.</h3>

				<h5>Academics</h5>
				<p>I graduated from New Milford High School in 2012 and started at RIT that Fall. My original major however was Chemical Engineering and I switched halfway through my second year. The reason for my switch was that I was spending my free time learning code and writing games instead of investing more time into a major I only half enjoyed. I am now in my fourth year and will be graduating in the Spring of 2017. </p>

				<h5>Life and Code</h5>
				<p>My first experience with coding was in high school when I took a class that taught Alice as an intro to programming. After that, I moved on to learning python on codeacademy and once I switched majors, C#. One of my jobs on campus is working for a professor in the software engineering department creating more accessible programs for those with visual impairments. I've worked on a programming environment for NXT robots that was created in Eclipse with Java and we also created a data analyzing web application written with HTML/CSS and JavaScript. I've also used my knowledge of programming to teach intro workshops on web development for the Women in Computing Organization on campus, as well as participate in their hackathon where my team built a web application that helps you find audition music for musicals. There was another hackathon at RIT this year called BrickHacks which I also participated in where my team created a chrome extension that allows you to raise a small creature as you surf the net.</p>
