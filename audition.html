			<h4>Audition Aid</h4>
			<h3 style="font-size:25px">Find your perfect piece!</h3>

			<h5>What This Web App is</h5>
			<p>
				This web app was created in order to assist musical auditioners with finding fitting songs for the parts they're trying out with. The reason we made it is that if you 
				search for audition songs online, all you'll get are tons of pages and yahoo answers suggesting the same songs over and over again that you hear at every audition. Our 
				tool instead uses its data base to suggest songs more tailored to the show and part you are auditioning for. It compares the age, vocal range, and gender of the part to 
				other musical songs to help give you a more extensive list to choose from. It's a much needed bridge between auditioners and the wealth of audition pieces, both classic 
				and contemporary, that could land them their dream role.
			</p>

			<h5>Where the Web App Came from</h5>
			<p>  
				Audition Aid came to be as our project for this year's Women in Computing Hackathon, or WiCHacks. It's a 24 hour hackathon for 14 year old women and up through graduate 
				students. Technologies that we included were HTML/CSS for the initial front-end, along with Twitter Bootstrap and jQuery. Our backend was created using the Flask microframework to help
				communicate with our database, which was set up using SQLite. The rest of the backend was written in the Python scripting language. We also used the Spotify API in order to create
				play buttons of the songs in the search results.
